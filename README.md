o	Calculate key profiling metrics (minimum, maximum, count, blanks) for numerical fields.
o	Standardize department and question labels for accuracy and consistency.
2.	Prepare clean data for visualization:
o	Calculate response frequencies and proportions (1–4 scale) for each of the 10 survey questions.
o	Compute average response scores to measure sentiment.
o	Organize the data into a "Chart Source" tab, sorted by average response for visualization.
3.	Visualize and interpret findings:
o	Create a 100% stacked bar chart (Likert scale) to show the distribution of responses by question.
o	Use color gradients (orange/red for negative, blue for positive) to emphasize sentiment differences.
o	Present insights and recommendations based on patterns in employee feedback.
