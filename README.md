## My-Excel-Skills
Multiple Excel projects ranging from data analysis and automation to advanced dashboard design. Progressed from PivotTables and formula-based modeling to expert-level tools like Power Query, Power Pivot, and interactive visual analytics.

## HR Survey Data Analysis – Washington City Employees
Analyzed survey responses from 1,500 city employees across Washington State using Excel to uncover trends in engagement, satisfaction, and workplace culture. Developed interactive dashboards and visual reports to support data-driven HR decisions in the government sector.

# Bonus Skill: Recreated the survey chart into a diverging stacked bar using calculated columns so that positive responses skew right and negative responses skew left, improving data interpretation and visual clarity.

## Insights and recommendations
1. Clear Role Expectations
Employees show exceptional clarity about their responsibilities, with 92% agreeing they know what is expected of them which is the strongest result across all areas.
Progress: Continue reinforcing clear communication of goals and performance metrics to maintain this strength.
3. Strong Supervisor Support
A notable 86% of employees feel their supervisor or someone at work genuinely cares about them which Demonstrates a positive and supportive managerial culture
Progress: Highlight these supervisors as role models and encourage similar leadership practices across all teams.
4. Weak Performance Accountability
Only 30% strongly agree that supervisors hold employees accountable, indicating inconsistent standards.
Recommendation: Provide leadership training focused on feedback, fairness, and performance management to foster accountability.
6. Recognition and Praise are Insufficient
Recognition received the lowest engagement score, with only 29% strongly agreeing they’ve been praised in the past week which can weaken motivation and commitment.
Recommendation: Introduce simple recognition systems such as peer shoutouts, instant rewards, or routine manager acknowledgments to celebrate achievements consistently.
8. Weak Social Connection at Work
Just over half of employees (52%) say they have a best friend at work which Indicates limited camaraderie and team bonding.
Recommendation: Encourage stronger interpersonal connections through team-building events, and collaborative projects.
10. Moderate Overall Job Satisfaction
About 77% are satisfied with their jobs, but only one-third express strong satisfaction shows employees are generally content but not deeply engaged.
Recommendation: Focus on enhancing recognition, growth opportunities, and workplace relationships to shift satisfaction from “good” to “great.”

# Project Goals
1.	Profile and QA the data:
o	Identify and remove blanks, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
o	Calculate key profiling metrics (minimum, maximum, count, blanks) for numerical fields.
o	Standardize department and question labels for accuracy and consistency.
2.	Prepare clean data for visualization:
o	Calculate response frequencies and proportions (1–4 scale) for each of the 10 survey questions.
o	Compute average response scores to measure sentiment.
o	Organize the data into a "Chart Source" tab, sorted by average response for visualization.
3.	Visualize and interpret findings:
o	Create a 100% stacked bar chart (Likert scale) to show the distribution of responses by question.
o	Use color gradients (orange/red for negative, blue for positive) to emphasize sentiment differences.
o	Present insights and recommendations based on patterns in employee feedback.
Tools & Techniques Used
•	Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, PivotTables, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIFS, and visualization
•	Data Preparation: Profiling, QA, text standardization, duplicate removal
•	Visualization: Likert-style 100% stacked bar chart with sentiment-based color coding
•	Analytics Skills: Data storytelling, HR metrics interpretation, trend identification

# Manufacturing Downtime Optimization Project
Goal:
Enhance overall production efficiency by identifying key downtime drivers, addressing operator skill gaps, and implementing actionable process improvements.
Overview:
This project focused on improving line performance across multiple operators in a manufacturing environment. Using data-driven insights, I assessed efficiency levels, analyzed downtime trends, and identified where focused training and operational adjustments could deliver the highest impact.
Key Insights:
•	The production line’s overall efficiency was 64%, indicating room for improvement in workflow and training.
•	Mac’s efficiency (61%) was the lowest, driven largely by delays in batch changeovers.
•	The top five downtime causes were Machine Adjustments, Machine Failures, Inventory Shortages, Batch Changes, and Batch Coding Errors accounted for 80% of total downtime.
•	Three out of the top five causes were related to operator error, highlighting the need for improved training and clearer standard operating procedures.
Recommendations & Actions:
•	Launch hands-on machine adjustment training for all operators to minimize manual setup time.
•	Introduce focused batch change training for Mac to improve changeover speed and accuracy.
•	Implement proactive maintenance checks and inventory monitoring to reduce delays caused by equipment and supply shortages.
•	Encourage a continuous improvement mindset by reviewing downtime metrics weekly and recognizing high-performing operators.
